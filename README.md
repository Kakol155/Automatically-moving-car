## General info
This program was created to the car could move automatically.
To create this car I used: Arduino uno board, motors controller, two distance sensors, four DC motors, a battery to power the car and a chassis with wheels.

## Technologies
* C++

## Project Status
- Ready

## Usage
- The car starts to move forward and keeps going, but when one of its sensors detects an obstacle, it reverses and turns around. The car then drives forward until it encounters an obstacle and repeats the action.
